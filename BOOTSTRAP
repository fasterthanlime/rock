Bootstrapping
=============

So you just checked out the rock git repository and ran `make` to
get a fancy executable. Nice try, but ...

rock is a *self-hosting* compiler, ie. it's written in ooc, and we
use rock to compile rock, and so you also need a rock executable to
compile rock.

True, it sounds complicated, but it doesn't have to be. Just go to
https://github.com/nddrylliog/rock/downloads and download the latest
bootstrap tarball (also called "bootstrap-only" tarball because it only
contains the bootstrap and nothing else) into your local clone of
rock. This tarball contains C sources generated by rock for a recent 
version of rock, which can be compiled with only a C compiler.

Extract, run `make` again. Enjoy.
